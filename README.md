## INTRODUCTION
The Abc ATM Banking System is a fictional ATM that combines the partial functionality of a bank and an ATM. The system simulates the creation of a bank account, validates a customer or client account number with a four digit pin and enables logged in customer to deposit or withdraw money. It also displays customer account details and transaction information on a table. The account numbers of users are generated by concatinating a two letter string with a pseudo random 14 digit number. The transaction number is also generated same way.

## USER EXPERIENCE UX
### USER STORIES
As a developer I want to create:
* a model of an ATM that will ease clients from the hassle of creating a bank account in addition to its normal functions.

As a general user I want to:
1. Easily navigate through the application
2. Be able to understand the purpose of the application
3. See the correctness of the validation of my input values

During this phase of the project design test repositories were created to try out visuals and initial features before establishing the final respository.

## SCOPE
For the implementation of the ATM banking system I have planned the following features:
- Data from spreadsheet that contains users account and transactions to be displayed to user in tables.
- Account creation starts from the begining of the program, if user has no account.
- User account will be validated, if correct an option screen will be displayed to user otherwise user will be refered back to create an accoount.
- The deposit option enables the user to add money to his/her account on passing the validation of the input data. The value of the amount, status and date time are inserted to the transaction spreadsheet table.
- The withdraw option like the deposit option enables user to remove money from his/her account if the amount input is valid. The amount requested by user, status and date time are inserted to the transactions spreadsheet table.
- The program displays warnings in all stages if input values are not given in the correct format.
- On demand a transaction table is displayed to the account holder if any, showing all his/her transactions with date time, amount and status with reasons if status is failure.



### FLOWCHART
The Flowchart for my program was created using [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=_chart_en_tier1_mixed_search_brand_exact_&km_CPC_CampaignId=1490375427&km_CPC_AdGroupID=55688909257&km_CPC_Keyword=lucidchart&km_CPC_MatchType=e&km_CPC_ExtensionID=&km_CPC_Network=g&km_CPC_AdPosition=&km_CPC_Creative=442433236001&km_CPC_TargetID=aud-809923745462:kwd-33511936169&km_CPC_Country=20483&km_CPC_Device=c&km_CPC_placement=&km_CPC_target=&gclid=CjwKCAiA2rOeBhAsEiwA2Pl7Q5KsmhzrrvhWJy2CYebbpJzHxt99Tj-XuCHr2wL0hH5yf4c1nGYkMhoCLYgQAvD_BwE) and it visually represents how the system works.

## FEATURES
### EXISTING FEATURES
The programm has a feature that will ease the work of bank workers by not taking the pains of registering every customer.
For simulating a real-life experience, the system is linked to a <b>Google Spreedsheet</b> that can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-2VbDweehojeCg4YcLQOBKUNskHD-2ef7-phK18IgQ/edit?usp=sharing).

- When the user launches the programm a welcome image is displayed with a question, if the user has an account or not.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/start.png)
- Any input error by the user is caught and the corresponding message is displayed.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/start_err.png)

- A no answer from the user will prompt the user to create an account.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/account.png)

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/create_err1.png)
- A yes answer implies the user has an account and the programm will prompt the user for validation of his/credentials thrice.
If the user is unable to give correct credentials the programm returns back to start welcome question state.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/acc_valid_err.png)

- If a user successfully logs in to the system, the option menu is displayed to the user.

- If the user chooses option 3, his/her account details are displayed in a table for the user.

- If the user chooses option 4, his/her transactions are shown on a table with the date time the transactions where made and there status.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/transaction.png)

- If the user chooses option 1, he/she will be promted to enter the amount in figures to deposit. The transaction will be inserted to the transaction table.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/depo_er.png)

- If the user chooses option 2, he/she will be prompted to enter the amount in figures, all errors are caught by the programm and the transaction is inserted into the transaction table.

## DATA STORAGE

The data used in this project is stored in google sheet through the google api cloud platform

### FUTURE FEATURES
- Implement a more modern and secure way to save users credentials
- Enable users to do payment of utilities(water,gas, internet, telephone, etc)
- Implement an email message sender to customers about there current account weekly.

### BUGS OR ERRORS
During the development process the desire to give a good user experience was placed as the first piority as a result the code to achieve that aim was refactored several times. Finally this was achieved by introducing the function (do_options) and validating each user input in the (create_user) function.
